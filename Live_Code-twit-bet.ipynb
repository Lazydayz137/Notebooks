Each company faces their own headwinds right now (beyond the scope of this tweet - with the exception of $NVDA which feels appropriately priced for accelerating fundamentals) - and their scale is such that they simply can't be immune to a severe deterioration in macro activity. The other 493 companies need to be looked at on a case by case basis, but generally aren't cheap if you believe forward earnings will be under pressure. And these smaller companies, along with the end consumer, represent the demand for the 7 mentioned. The economy is not the stock market, but the two feel increasingly out of touch, with the $SPX trading ~20x during an economic slowdown with the funds rate going from zero to >5% in a short period of time. Also the market seems to be ignoring the lagged impacts of monetary policy.\n",

            "For one indicator of just how necessary something so simple as a door can be, we can look at Janus‚Äô revenue results. The company has a solid record of year-over-year top line growth in recent quarters, and the last reported results, from 1Q23, were no exception. Janus‚Äô revenue total, of $251.9 million, came in $9.25 million better than had been forecast ‚Äì and was up 9.75% year-over-year. At the bottom line, Janus recorded adj. EPS of 18 cents, beating the forecast by a penny, and jumping 5 cents per share from the prior year‚Äôs Q1 result.\n",
            "\n",
            "Looking ahead, Janus guided toward 2023 full-year revenue in the range of $1.06 billion to $1.08 billion, up from the previous range of $1.05 billion to $1.07 billion. At the midpoint, the new revenue guidance represents a 5% increase when compared to 2022 and meets Street expectations.\n",
            "\n",
            "The company‚Äôs sound results and optimistic outlook, combined with its industry-leading position, caught the eye of Benchmark‚Äôs 5-star analyst Reuben Garner, who wrote, ‚ÄúWith a strong quarter under its belt and solid backlog, management raised guidance for FY23 topline and EBITDA (roughly by the 1Q beat), and the company remains nicely on track for its mid-term targets issued last quarter‚Ä¶ While we aren‚Äôt sure when the discount/disconnect will close between Janus‚Äô fundamentals (and performance) and the stock‚Äôs valuation, we are increasingly confident that it ultimately should and will. With other names in our group making a run of late and Janus‚Äô multiple discount to its peer group increasing to nearly 50%, we are moving JBI to our Top Pick.‚Äù\n",
            "\n",
            "Going forward from this stance, Garner rates JBI shares as a Buy, and his $16 price target indicates room for 66% share growth on the one-year time horizon.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the Street, it‚Äôs rather quiet on the JBI front. Only one other has recently chimed in with a review. Adding their Hold into the mix, Janus gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating. Shares are priced at $9.62, and the $13.50 average price target implies a one-year upside potential of 40%.\n",

            "Genius Sports (GENI)\n",
            "\n",
            "For as long as people have competed at sports, there has been sports betting. Gamblers will bet on the results of games, fans will bet on their favorite teams, casual gamers will place a bet for a thrill. Genius Sports, a tech firm working in data management and integrity, provides software services for sports betting and media companies, offering improved quality for the sports data needed by leagues, teams, and fans. Genius partners with over 650 sports organizations, and covers some 240,000 sports events.\n",
            "\n",
            "The firm was founded back in 2001, in London, and has since grown to become a globe-spanning operation. Genius Sports counts more than 1,800 people on its staff, and boasts offices in New York, LA, Medellin, Sofia, and Vilnius. The company‚Äôs technology is used in more than 150 countries, and major leagues ‚Äì including the NFL, NASCAR, and the NCAA ‚Äì depend on Genius for accurate data.\n",
            "\n",
            "While Genius has carved out a solid niche for itself, in an industry that drips cash, the company‚Äôs results in the 1Q23 period were mixed. The total revenue figure was solid; Genius brought in $97.23 million at the top line, up more than 13% y/y and nearly $5 million ahead of the expectations. At the bottom line, however, the company‚Äôs earnings came in just under the estimates. The reported EPS was negative, a 12-cent loss per share, and 1-cent worse than had been anticipated.\n",
            "\n",
            "These mixed results were more than balanced by the company‚Äôs outlook going forward. Genius is guiding toward Q2 revenue of $80 million vs. consensus at $78.05 million, and for Q3, the $99 million revenue guidance was also above the $97.44 million expected on Wall Street.\n",
            "\n",
            "All of this is background to JMP analyst Jordan Bender‚Äôs notes on Genius Sports. He sees the company holding an advantageous position in the sports betting arena, and getting a boost from its access to data rights. Bender says of Genius, ‚ÄúWe are now recommending shares of GENI as our top pick in our coverage universe. The online sports betting ecosystem is vast, and companies are fighting for their piece of the pie. The company operates in the most attractive part of a complex ecosystem by owning long-term data rights necessary for any betting operator to price bets, while only competing against one major company globally.¬†Management has checked nearly all the boxes including 1) hitting quarterly estimates, 2) removing the SPAC warrants, 3) investing in its technology to insulate itself from potential competition, and 4) positioning itself for a FCF inflection.‚Äù\n",
            "\n",
            "All of this adds up to an Outperform (Buy) rating, in Bender‚Äôs eyes, and his $8 price target points toward share growth of 41% over the next year.\n",
            "\n",
            "There‚Äôs a general optimism on Wall Street about this stock, evidenced by the 6 unanimously positive analyst reviews which give GENI shares their Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $5.66, and at $7, the average share price suggests a 24% one-year gain.\n",

            "Alight, Inc. (ALIT)\n",
            "\n",
            "We‚Äôll wrap up with software company Alight, a firm that offers business process software products on the popular subscription model ‚Äì call it BPaaS. The company‚Äôs products are designed to bring cloud-based solutions to business processes, analytics, and human capital. The company makes use of AI to improve process automation and risk management, while predicting customer needs and capabilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "Alight provides these critical services to enterprise customers in the healthcare, wealth management, and payroll industries, at any scale needed. The company‚Äôs flagship platform, Worklife, has been shown to provide a solid ROI, through actionable insights and desirable outcomes. Alight itself has benefited from a combination of diversified customers, long-tenured blue-chip clients, and a recurring revenue model that supports both strong cash flows and future growth. At the end of last year, Alight could depend on a revenue stream composed 84% of annual recurring revenue, and a solid 98% average revenue retention rate.\n",
            "\n",
            "In its recent 1Q23 results, Alight showed nearly 15% y/y top line revenue growth, with the $831 million reported beating the estimates by $27.35 million. The company‚Äôs bottom line, an adj. EPS of $0.13, was 1-cent better than the forecast and 1-cent better than the year-ago result. The company‚Äôs BPaaS revenue grew 50% y/y, and cumulative BPaaS bookings passed $1.5 billion.\n",
            "\n",
            "The strong BPaaS performance was the first metric noted by Needham analyst Kyle Peterson, who does not hesitate to paint an upbeat picture of the stock‚Äôs prospects: ‚ÄúAs BPaaS deals continue to become a larger piece of the business (BPaaS revenue is expected to grow 15%+ MT(midterm)), ALIT expects total revenue growth of 6-8%, EBITDA margin expansion of 400‚Äì500 bps and operating cash flow conversion of 60-80% over the MT. We view the MT financial framework as attractive and attainable given the numerous revenue growth levers, ongoing cost optimization efforts, and the sizable TAM which we believe provides ample room for LT growth.‚Äù\n",
            "\n",
            "‚ÄúWith the shares trading at an EV/EBITDA of ~9x our FY24 estimate, we view the risk-reward as favorable. ALIT remains our Top Pick for 2023,‚Äù Peterson went on to say.\n",
            "\n",
            "In-line with this stance, Peterson gives the stock a Buy rating, with a $13 price target that indicates room for 44% share appreciation in the year ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "This is another stock with a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating ‚Äì this one based on 4 positive analyst reviews. The shares are currently trading for $9.00, and the $13.17 average price target suggests a 46% increase from that level in the next 12 months.\n",

            "As of June 6, one ETF has taken in more money than any other ETF through 2023, with $11.3 billion in inflows, according to FactSet data. But it's not a hot new artificial intelligence fund, or an ETF that capitalizes on other popular tech trends, though it will give you a sense of them. Instead, it's arguably one of the most boring generic ETFs out there, but that doesn't mean it can't help you grow your portfolio. It is the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO). In fact, whether you're just starting out on your investing journey or you're an experienced trader who's been in the investing game for years, this humble but massive ETF can serve as a solid cornerstone for your portfolio. that's why.\n",
            "Harness the power of the entire S&P 500 in your portfolio\n",
            "The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has over $300 billion in assets under management (AUM), making it the third largest ETF on the market today. While there are many sophisticated investment strategies and products that claim to provide investors with a market edge, VOO keeps it simple. It invests in the S&P 500 Index, which consists of about 500 of the 500 largest U.S. stocks and is arguably the most important and influential index in the investing world.\n",
            "The S&P 500 covers all sectors of the U.S. economy, so instead of betting on individual sectors, an ETF like VOO gives you exposure to them all‚Äîfrom tech leaders like Apple and Microsoft to old favorites like Caterpillar and Deere. Among the economic industrial giants and so on.\n",
            "The great thing about VOO is that it allows investors to harness the power and innovation of a large swath of the U.S. economy in one investment vehicle without having to pick a favorite sector or stock. Investing in VOO is essentially a bet that some 500 of the top publicly traded companies in the U.S. will continue to innovate and become profitable over time, which has historically been a successful proposition.\n",
            "Since it tracks the S&P 500 itself, the fund is very diversified, with 504 holdings, and its top 10 positions represent just 27.8% of assets. As you can see, Apple has a 7.2% stake in the fund, followed by Microsoft at 6.6%, with Amazon, Nvidia and Alphabet (Class A) rounding out the top five. It wasn't just tech stocks, however, with Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway and energy giant Exxon Mobil not far behind.\n",
            "As you can see in the table, VOO's top properties have a fairly solid collection of Smart Scores. In fact, four of the top 10 holdings‚ÄîApple, Nvidia, Alphabet, and UnitedHealth Group‚Äîhave \"Perfect 10\" Smart Scores. Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks.\n",
            "Do Analysts Think VOO Stock Is a Buy?\n",
            "\n",
            "So, quantitative factors rate VOO high, but what do Wall Street analysts think? VOO has a Moderate Buy consensus rating on TipRanks, based on analyst ratings, and VOO's average price target of $445.50 implies an upside potential of 11.9%.\n",
            "investor friendly fees\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to adequate diversification and broad exposure, another attractive feature of VOO is its low expense ratio. It's hard to beat VOO's paltry fee rate of just 0.03%. Investors who put $10,000 into VOO pay only $3 in fees for the first year. This investor-friendly fee structure helps investors defend their portfolio's principal over time without paying too much in fees. For example, assuming this fee stays the same, and the fund returns 5% per year for the next 10 years, investors would pay only $39 in fees over the decade. Compared to the many ETFs on the market with 0.75% expense ratios where investors are paying $75 on a $10,000 investment in the first year, you really see the value proposition of an ETF like VOO.\n",
            "\n",
            "stable long-term performance\n",
            "\n",
            "With such diversification and an investor-friendly expense ratio, it's easy to see why this mammoth ETF is the most popular ETF for inflows so far this year. Still, there's another factor contributing to its popularity - its long track record. VOO has long delivered double-digit annualized total returns to its investors. No matter which time frame you look at, VOO has delivered. As of the end of May, VOO had an annualized total return of 12.8% over the three-year time frame. Over a five-year time horizon, the mammoth ETF provided a total return of 11% per year. Additionally, VOO has returned 11.9% annually over the past 10 years. Since its inception in 2010, VOO has achieved an annualized return of 13.3% since its inception that year.\n",

            "Keeping it simple can pay off\n",
            "\n",
            "It doesn't hurt to keep it simple. While there are plenty of exotic investment strategies out there, few can beat an ETF like VOO over the long-term. While this S&P 500 ETF isn't the kind of investment that can give you multiple pockets of returns in a year, the reality is that very few investments do. However, the good news is that investing in large-cap ETFs like these and letting those gains compound over the years is a time-tested way to build long-term wealth. When investors have a cash surplus and/or the S&P 500 falls, they can average dollar costs over time while reinvesting dividends to further amplify those results.\n",
            "\n",
            "VOO's strong track record, investor-friendly expense ratio, and portfolio of about 500 top U.S. stocks make it a long-term winner and likely to remain a winner for the foreseeable future.\n"
